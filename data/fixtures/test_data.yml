      CodeSnippet is a collection of Java libraries to convert various types of
      source code such as CSS, DTD, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSP, and XML to HTML
      with syntax highlighting and line number support. CodeSnippet can be used
      by applications that need to display source code as HTML with syntax
      highlighting. For example, desktop search applications, developer forums,
      and code browsers can use it. CodeSnippet also forms the basis of
      CodeSnippet4Eclipse, CodeSnippet4IDEA, and CodeSnippet4NetBeans plugins
      which are also developed by our organization.
      
      Although there are many similar projects developed with the PHP, .NET, and
      JavaScript technology, there are just a few for Java. Moreover, the ones
      that are available are not flexible enough to generate the output HTML
      with different colors and text styles. CodeSnippet is a strong candidate
      to fill this gap. CodeSnippet is managed with Maven ( a project management
      framework from ASF ) and it consist of multiple modules where there is a
      module for each type of source code. Thanks to this, applications can use
      the modules they need, rather than adding all to their classpath which
      consequently increase the footprint. This modular architecture moves
      CodeSnippet one step ahead of its rivals.
      
      Converting a source code to HTML requires that type source code to be
      parsed. However, writing a parser for a programming language is a hard and
      time-consuming job. Instead of writing a parser from scratch, we use
      JavaCC ( a parser generator from Sun ) to automatically generate the
      parsers using language grammars which are already available in the
      community. This implementation choice will greatly shorten the development
      time.

      CodeSnippet is a set of Eclipse plug-ins to convert Ant, Java, Properties,
      CSS, DTD, HTML, and XML source code (complete files or snippets) to HTML
      with syntax highlighting.
    description: >
      Syntax highlighting is a feature of IDEs (Integrated Development
      Environments) that display source code in different colors and text styles
      according to the category of terms which include keywords, comments,
      control-flow statements, variables, and other elements. This feature
      improves the readability and context of the source code, and makes the
      developers' life a lot easier. However, when some part of source code is
      posted in a forum or to a blog, the syntax highlighting disappears and it
      becomes a plain text which makes it very hard to distinguish different
      types of language elements. Although some web sites like Sun's Developer
      Forums provides syntax highlighting support, there seems to be a need for
      a general solution at the client side.
      
      CodeSnippet is an Eclipse plug-in that solves this problem. It can convert
      Ant, Java, Properties, CSS, DTD, HTML, JavaScript, JSP, and XML source
      code to HTML with syntax highlighting and line number support. Unlike
      existing solutions, CodeSnippet supports numerous file formats, and it
      does not require any custom configuration related with the color and text
      style information. It obtains this information directly from the related
      Eclipse editor. When CodeSnippet plug-in is installed, a new menu item
      (Export > HTML) appears in the popup menus of the supported editors. Users
      can generate the HTML by selecting some portion of the source code or the
      complete file from the Navigation View, and then selecting "Export >
      HTML". According to the preference generated HTML can be written to a file
      or copied to the system clipboard.

    subject: CodeSnippet for Eclipse version 1.0.0 (stable) released
    details: >
      CodeSnippet plug-ins for Eclipse are released. CodeSnippet plug-ins can
      convert various types of source code (complete files or snippets) to HTML
      with syntax highlighting. CodeSnippet will colorize your blogs with
      highlighted code samples. Give it a try; you won't regret it! 
      
      Unlike existing solutions, CodeSnippet supports several file formats (
      Ant, CSS, DTD, HTML, Java, Properties, and XML ) and it does not require
      any custom configuration related with the color and text style information.
      Instead, this information is directly obtained from the related editor.
      You can install CodeSnippet plug-ins via update site whose URL is given
      below. CodeSnippet is also listed at EclipsePlugins and Eclipse Plugin
      Central. Please, take sometime and rate our plug-in using the related

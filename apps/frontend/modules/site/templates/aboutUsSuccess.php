<h1>About Us</h1>
<?php echo image_tag('divider.png', 'class=divider') ?>
<p>Hoydaa is an open source software community whose sole purpose is to
develop, deliver and maintain high quality, robust and regularly
supported software. Platforms and technologies used may vary but the
delivered quality and support will not change.</p>
<p>When starting projects, selectivity will be the main criteria to
decide for Hoydaa.</p>
<p>As of all knows, the biggest problem of the open source projects is
the lack of quality and regular support. Hoydaa will not allow projects
without the quality and regular support.</p>
<p>&quot;Deliver few, deliver complete&quot; is the main idea behind
Hoydaa. Quality and support is more important than the number of
projects for us.</p>
<p>We will show the same sensitivity while selecting team members for
our projects. No team that is not adequate will be allowed to start
projects under Hoydaa.</p>
